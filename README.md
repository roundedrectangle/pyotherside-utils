# pyotherside-utils

Some personal stuff shared across my (SailfishOS) pyotherside-based projects.

To install:

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall https://github.com/roundedrectangle/pyotherside-utils/releases/download/latest/pyotherside_utils-1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

# TODO

- Caching: add more stuff like checking if update_period is None, or even unifying the session system
- Caching: unify some methods which simply call other methods
- Maybe add a QML part? For stuff like caching and proxy settings
